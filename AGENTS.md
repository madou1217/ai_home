# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `lib/` contains runtime code, CLI commands, server logic, and service modules.
- `lib/cli/commands/` holds command routers and command entry logic.
- `lib/cli/services/` holds business logic (import/export, PTY, account orchestration, etc.).
- `lib/cli/bootstrap/` wires dependencies between commands and services.
- `test/` contains Node test files (`*.test.js`) covering CLI, backup, PTY, server, and wiring behavior.
- `bin/ai-home.js` is the CLI executable entry.
- `docs/` contains project documentation and operational notes.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install`: install dependencies.
- `npm test`: run full test suite (`node --test test/*.test.js`).
- `node --test test/backup.router.test.js`: run a focused test file during iteration.
- `node bin/ai-home.js --help`: verify CLI bootstrap and command wiring.
- `npm run postinstall`: repair local executable permissions/hooks (already runs after install).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: Node.js CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`).
- Formatting style in repo: 2-space indentation, semicolons, single quotes.
- File names use kebab-case (for example `account-import-orchestrator.js`).
- Prefer small, composable functions; avoid feature growth in one large file.

## Architecture & Layering Principles
- Enforce separation of concerns: each module should have one clear responsibility (composition, domain logic, integration, or I/O).
- Keep orchestration and business logic separate. Flow control modules should delegate behavior to focused service modules.
- Depend inward on abstractions, not outward on concrete implementation details. Avoid circular dependencies across layers.
- Add new behavior by extending focused modules, not by growing “god files.”
- Refactor trigger: if a file mixes unrelated responsibilities or becomes difficult to test in isolation, split it before further feature work.
- Exceptions must be explicit in PR notes, including why boundary-preserving design was not feasible and what follow-up refactor is planned.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: built-in Node test runner (`node:test`) with `assert/strict`.
- Name tests by behavior, e.g. `test('runGlobalAccountImport reports provider progress callback', ...)`.
- Add/adjust tests for every behavior change, including fallback paths and error handling.
- Run targeted tests first, then run full `npm test` before submitting changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow conventional-style messages seen in history: `feat(...)`, `fix(...)`, `refactor(...)`.
- Keep commits focused (one logical change per commit).
- PRs should include:
  - purpose and scope,
  - key files changed,
  - test evidence (commands + pass result),
  - screenshots/log snippets for CLI UX changes when relevant.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit real tokens or credential exports.
- Validate import paths and avoid absolute/parent traversal inputs.
- Prefer environment-based configuration for sensitive runtime settings.
